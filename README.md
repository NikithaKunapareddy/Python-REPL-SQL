# 🚀 Python-REPL-SQL

## 📖 Overview

A comprehensive Python-based travel booking system that combines SQLite database operations with an intelligent agent capable of executing functions through REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) based on natural language input. This system demonstrates the integration of Natural Language Inference (NLI) with database operations and dynamic pricing algorithms.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

> 💡 **How it works**: Natural language gets translated into executable Python functions through an intelligent REPL agent!

The system follows this execution flow:

```
User says: "total price for user nikitha"
        ↓
agent_repl.py: Translates to → Complex SQL + fetch_and_explain_booking() calls
        ↓
REPL executes: Generated Python code with database queries
        ↓
fetch_and_calculate.py: Called multiple times for each booking calculation
        ↓
Returns: Route-wise summary + total price
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

> 🚀 **Get Started**: Ready to see the magic in action? Try these examples!

### 🎮 Starting the System

> ⚠️ **Setup Order**: Always run `python admin.py` first to populate database, then `python agent_repl.py` for queries and bookings!

#### Step 1: Database Setup
```bash
python admin.py
# This creates users, routes, and sample bookings
```

#### Step 2: Create New Bookings (Optional)
```bash
python booking.py
# Interactive booking system to create new reservations
# This adds more bookings to the database
```

#### Step 3: REPL Agent (Main Interface)
```bash
python agent_repl.py
# Now you can:
# - Query existing bookings: "show booking 1", "total for nikitha"
# - Calculate prices for any booking ID that exists in the database
```

### 💬 Natural Language Commands

### 📋 Detailed Example Session

> 🎯 **Live Demo**: Here's exactly what happens when you interact with the agent!
```bash
$ python agent_repl.py

🤖 TravelBookingAgent initialized with LOCAL REPL execution.
💬 You: show booking 9

🤖 Agent executing in LOCAL REPL: result = fetch_and_explain_booking(9)
============================================================
Booking ID: 9
Route: chennai -> london (flight)
Base price: 65000.0
Seats total: 3
Seats left at booking: 3

--- Calculation Details ---
Demand factor = 1 + (1 - seats_left / seats_total) * 0.5
              = 1 + (1 - 3 / 3) * 0.5
              = 1 + (0.00) * 0.5
              = 1.00

Price after demand = base_price * demand_factor
                  = 65000.0 * 1.00
                  = 65000.0

Discount applied = 50.0%
Final price = price_after_demand * (1 - discount/100)
           = 65000.0 * (1 - 50.0/100)
           = 32500.0

## 🧮 Pricing Algorithm

> 💡 **Smart Pricing**: Advanced algorithms that factor in demand, loyalty, and user types!

The system uses a sophisticated pricing model:

1. **Base Price**: Set per route
2. **Demand Factor**: `1 + (1 - seats_left/seats_total) * 0.5`
3. **Child Discount**: 50% off for child travelers
4. **Loyalty Discount**: Based on user points and discount rules
5. **Final Price**: `base_price * demand_factor * (1 - discount/100)`

> 🏆 **Award-Winning Algorithm**: Our pricing engine adapts in real-time to market conditions and user behavior!

| User totals | "total for nikitha" | `fetch_all_bookings_for_user("nikitha")` |
| Multiple bookings | "bookings 1,2,3" | Multiple `fetch_and_explain_booking()` calls |
| Ownership | "who owns booking 7" | Booking ownership query |
| All bookings | "show all bookings" | Complete booking list |
